# Contracts

This directory contains the production smart contract crates. Each subdirectory owns one contract domain or shared contract interface, while [lib](lib/src/lib.rs) keeps reusable support code.

## Architecture

The workspace mixes ink! contracts and Soroban-oriented helpers. Most contract crates expose their main behavior from a `src/lib.rs` file, while a few legacy or compatibility crates keep `lib.rs` at the crate root.

The contract workspace members can be found in [../Cargo.toml](../Cargo.toml).

The shared traits used by multiple contracts can be found in [traits/src/lib.rs](traits/src/lib.rs).

## Tradeoffs

This README focuses on major contract entry points rather than documenting every test and helper file. That keeps the map useful for reviewers while the source-level comments explain function behavior closer to the code.

Each contract crate remains independent because the repository needs maintainers to review changes by domain. The tradeoff is some repeated patterns across crates, especially authorization and migration hooks.
